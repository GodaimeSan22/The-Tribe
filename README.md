and follows **Agile** practices, with **Scrum** as the development framework.
 The team is composed of __ members, all beginners in game development, working part-time (15 hours per week).

## Technologies Used
- **Godot 4.x** (Game Engine)
- **C#** (Main scripting language)
- **GDScript** (For UI & smaller gameplay logic)
- **Aseprite** (Pixel art graphics)
- **FMOD/Audacity** (Sound effects & music)

## Game Mechanics

### Gathering Resources
Players will interact with various resources (trees, rocks, berries) to gather wood, stone, and food. 
Resource nodes will deplete over time and need to be replenished or moved to a new location.

### Building Structures
Players can place huts, campfires, and storage buildings to expand and protect their tribe. 
Each structure has specific requirements and costs in terms of resources.

### Tribe Management
Each tribe member will have needs (e.g., hunger, cold) that must be met for them to work efficiently. 
Players will assign work tasks and ensure their tribe survives the harsh environment.

### Wildlife & AI
Wild animals, such as deer and wolves, will populate the world. 
Some animals are passive and can be hunted for food, while others are hostile and pose a threat to the tribe.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Launch the game and you will be introduced to your tribe.
2. **Gather Resources**: Use the mouse to interact with resource nodes (trees, rocks, berries) and collect materials.
3. **Build Structures**: Select the build menu, drag-and-drop buildings onto the map, and ensure you have enough resources.
4. **Manage Hunger & Cold**: Keep an eye on your tribe’s hunger and temperature levels. 
Build campfires and gather food to keep them healthy.
5. **Control Tribe Members**: Assign tasks such as chopping wood, hunting, and building structures. 
Characters will prioritize work based on their needs (e.g., food when hungry).
